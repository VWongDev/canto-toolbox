# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

The extension will work without these icons (Chrome will use default icons), but custom icons should be added for a polished appearance.
